# K-means
Requires: Iris (flower) dataset

The main idea is to classify data that are not necessary labelled. K-means will partition the dataset in k groups (or clusters).

When you have a labelled dataset, like in this case, you know how many clusters you would want to set in your program. When you do not have labelled data, you still have to propose a value for k: such models are referred to as *semi-supervised* models. Obviously, different values for k will lead to different results. Without labels, you donâ€™t know a priority which value to use (k can be approximated using dedicated methods, [click here](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29957/Proposal-Face.pdf) to see examples on this subject).
